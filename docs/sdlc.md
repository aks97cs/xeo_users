# Development Life Cycle

## What is SDLC?
SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. 
It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. 
The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.

## Testing the Product
This stage is usually a subset of all the stages as in the modern SDLC models, the testing activities are mostly involved in all the stages of SDLC. 
However, this stage refers to the testing only stage of the product where product defects are reported, tracked, fixed and retested, until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS.
